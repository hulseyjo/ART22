<h1> Project 1 Vector Graphics</h1>
<p>To make my digital design for Southworth Planetarium, I first wrote down everything I wanted to include in my design – elements of the planetarium, of Portland, Maine, and of USM. I laid out which elements I wanted to utilize from each of the main elements and tried to put them together in a few different ways. I drew out 2-3 different designs and then picked which one I liked the best to further edit and add more detail to. I knew right off the bat that I wanted to include the Portland skyline in some way and I knew I wanted to include some typography since I had never done that before and I thought it may add a unique element to the design. I found that drawing out my design ideas first helped me to transfer them into digital format more efficiently since the design process was already done, it just needed to be finalized as a digital design. 
<br>I am relatively happy with my overall design, although there are certainly parts of it I would improve or enhance if I were to do it again and there are things I would do differently for my next project. While I didn’t receive any feedback from classmates, I can agree with the feedback I received for my grade, which was spacing out “Southworth” and the edge of the city line and darkening the yellow to make it more visible. I knew I wanted to incorporate USM’s school colors but I wasn’t sure how well the yellow would work since it's such a light color. It works well against the dark colors, but definitely gets toned down next to the white background. <br>During this project, I learned more about design in general and how to use Adobe Illustrator. By actually playing around with the different tools and formatting options, I was able to understand how to work with digital design a bit better and gauge where I can improve or learn more. I am excited to continue working with Adobe Illustrator and improve my skills. </p>
